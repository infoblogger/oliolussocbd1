<h1 style="text-align: justify;">What is IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis)?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is the type of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary Fibrosis is a health disorder that causes stiffness of the lungs. It also causes scarring of the lungs and the patient suffering from Pulmonary Fibrosis can't breathe properly. Pulmonary Fibrosis is the root of many other serious diseases such as heart failure. The patient can't get enough oxygen from the air into the lungs and eventually it causes heart failure or respiratory failure. There are different causes of Pulmonary Fibrosis such as</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Use of certain chemical</li>
<li>Bacterial or viral infection</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Impaired immune system</li>
<li>Genetic disorders</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is the type of Pulmonary Fibrosis in which doctors unable to determine the exact cause or reason for this disease. The treatment of IPF is somewhat difficult with respect to the other type of Pulmonary Fibrosis (FPF-Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis) because the source is not understandable in it. At present, the doctor is trying to treat IPF with different medications and drugs which are approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). IPF cannot be eradicated completely by using these drugs but it can only slow down the progression of the disease and avoid exacerbations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IPF can cause major respiratory failure but in severe condition, it can lead to some other dangerous diseases also such as,</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Lung Cancer</li>
<li>Pulmonary Hypertension</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
<li>Heart failure</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Major symptoms of IPF are,</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Aching and inflammation in the joints and muscles</li>
<li>Dyspnea (Breathe Shortness)</li>
<li>Cough</li>
<li>Sudden weight loss</li>
</ul>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">What is CBD Oil and its relation with IPF?</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD Oil (Cannabidiol) is the chemical extract of the hemp (Cannabis) plant. It is a pure, non-psychoactive, and non-toxic extract of the hemp plant. CBD Oil has a very high potential to relieve pain and reduce inflammation that is why it might be used in heart diseases, Lyme disease inflammation, and pain in joints.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though it is not medically proven, but CBD Oil has considerable relation with IPF. According to a study in 2015, CBD can help open up bronchia passages in patients suffering from IPF. CBD might enable the patients to breathe easily in comparison to other drugs and medicines. CBD oil also helps the patient to avoid low blood oxygen levels and other lung's related complications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another study in 2014 (On the mice) has reported that CBD oil helps in the reduction of inflammation in the lungs during IPF and improves the recovery of damaged lungs. But there is a limitation with these studies. Most of these research studies have been done on animals rather than humans.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&uuml; CBD oil for relieving pain and inflammation in IPF:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD has tremendous pain-relieving and inflammation-reducing properties. These properties are very helpful to alleviate the symptoms of IPF. In IPF, the patient feels severe pain due to inflammation in the lungs. If there will be no reduction in inflammation of the lungs, the patient can suffer from lung cancer which is a life-threatening disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBD oil relieves pain and inflammation by interacting with the Endocannabinoid system of the body. The Endocannabinoid system (ECS) is the assistant to the immune system in the body. ECS regulates many important functions in the body such as pain, inflammation, emotion, and memory, etc. ECS has two kinds of receptors, CB1 receptors, and CB2 receptors. CBD oil binds with the CB1 receptors and regulate it in such a way that it reduces pain reception by CNS (Central Nervous System). In this way, the patient feels less pain in IPF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When CBD oil reacts with CB2 receptors, it regulates or decreases the secretion of Cytokines. Cytokines are chemical which is responsible for inflammation production. By reducing the secretion of Cytokines, CBD oil reduces inflammation.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">&uuml; Be cautious if you are thinking to use CBD oil for IPF:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be cautious if you are thinking to use CBD oil for IPF because there has been a shortage of CBD research. There is very little information available regarding CBD oil working in IPF treatment such as what is the exact dose of CBD oil? How long it should be used for good results and what are the side effects of the CBD oil on your health? All these questions are unknown medically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best person who can guide you about the correct use of CBD oil is your family doctor. You can consult with him/her about the benefits, uses, dose, and side effects of the CBD oil for IPF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In light of our recommendation, you should start using CBD oil with a minimum quantity first. It will be very helpful for you in analyzing the effects of CBD oil on your body and state of IPF. By analyzing the effects of minor doses, you can plan larger doses with the help of your family doctor.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Conclusion:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) is a very serious and life-threatening lung disease in which the exact source of the disease is completely unknown. Traditionally, doctors treat this disease with the help of traditional drugs and medicine. These drugs and medicine can only slow down the propagation of disease and unable to completely eradicate it. CBD oil might be effective in IPF because it has the potential to relieve pain and reduce inflammation in the lungs. But it should be used very cautiously because there is very little information available about it and it is not recognized medically also. But still, if you are thinking of using it, you should consult your doctor first.</p>
